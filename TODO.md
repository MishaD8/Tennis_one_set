● Step-by-Step Todo List for Tennis Project Improvements

  I've created a comprehensive 15-item todo list prioritized by importance and impact. Here's the breakdown:

  🔴 HIGH PRIORITY (Fix First)

  1. 🔒 API Key Security - Move sensitive keys from config.json to environment variables
  2. 🧹 Clean Duplicate Data - Remove duplicate player rankings in predictor integration
  3. ⚠️ Error Handling - Add try-catch blocks for API calls and ML predictions
  4. 🔧 Critical System Fixes - Address errors identified in your analysis report

  🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Performance & Features)

  5. 📊 Data Caching - Implement caching to reduce API calls
  6. 🎯 Model Optimization - Fine-tune ensemble weights based on performance
  7. 🏗️ Surface Features - Add clay/grass/hard court specific player stats
  8. ⚙️ Config Management - Separate dev/prod configurations
  9. 🗄️ Database Upgrade - Replace CSV files with PostgreSQL
  10. 🚦 Rate Limiting - Prevent API quota issues
  11. 🔄 Rankings Update - Refresh player data to latest
  12. 🎾 Tournament Testing - Test with current active matches

  🟢 LOW PRIORITY (Polish & Documentation)

  11. 🧪 Unit Tests - Add tests for models and collectors
  12. 📈 Monitoring - Set up alerting for failures
  13. 📚 Documentation - Create API docs and deployment guides

  Recommended approach: Start with items 1-4 (security and critical fixes), then tackle 5-10 (performance
  improvements), and finally 11-15 (testing and documentation).
