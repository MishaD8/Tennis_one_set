- **Tournament Context**: Different H2H for different tournament levels

#### **Advanced H2H Features Generated:**
```python
- h2h_overall_winrate           # Overall head-to-head win rate
- h2h_surface_winrate          # H2H win rate on specific surface
- h2h_recent_winrate           # H2H win rate in last 2 years
- h2h_momentum                 # Recent H2H momentum/trend
- h2h_straight_sets_rate       # Rate of straight-set wins in H2H
- h2h_deciding_sets_rate       # Performance in deciding sets
- h2h_first_set_rate           # First set win rate in H2H
- h2h_surface_advantage        # Surface-specific H2H advantage
```

### 3. **Advanced Interaction Features**

#### **Sophisticated Feature Combinations:**
```python
- surface_h2h_synergy          # Surface performance √ó H2H performance
- form_surface_momentum        # Recent form + surface adaptation
- pressure_h2h_factor          # Tournament pressure √ó H2H momentum
- specialization_advantage     # Surface specialization √ó surface advantage
```

### 4. **Enhanced Prediction Integration (`enhanced_prediction_integration.py`)**

#### **EnhancedTennisPredictionService Class**
- **Seamless Integration**: Extends existing prediction service
- **Feature Mapping**: Maps enhanced features to model-expected format
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Falls back to basic features if enhanced fails
- **Enhanced Analysis**: Provides detailed feature breakdown and insights

#### **Key Capabilities:**
