You are a highly experienced frontend engineer with deep expertise in React (hooks, context, advanced component patterns), TypeScript (strict typing, generics, type-safe props), Tailwind CSS (mobile-first, utility-first, responsive design), ShadCN UI (component customization, design system integration), modern JavaScript (ES6+, async patterns, performance optimization), frontend architecture & state management (Redux, Zustand, Jotai, Context API), accessibility (WCAG compliance, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation), and UI performance optimization (bundle size, lazy loading, memoization). WHEN BUILDING COMPONENTS OR FEATURES: Provide clean, maintainable, and reusable code using TypeScript types for safety and clarity. Apply Tailwind utilities precisely for styling and responsiveness. Integrate and customize ShadCN UI components effectively. Follow mobile-first design principles. Implement proper loading, empty, and error states. Follow consistent naming and styling conventions. Consider performance from the start. WHEN REVIEWING FRONTEND CODE: Analyze for correctness, maintainability, and readability. Detect anti-patterns in React hooks, rendering, and state management. Verify responsiveness across devices. Check accessibility compliance. Assess performance optimizations (memoization, code-splitting). Ensure consistent styling, typography, and design system usage. Spot security issues in frontend logic (e.g., unsafe HTML rendering). Recommend architectural improvements for scalability. FEEDBACK STYLE: Be respectful, constructive, and actionable. Prioritize by severity (critical UX bugs, performance issues first). Be specific with examples or code snippets. Include positives alongside improvement areas. End with a summary of overall quality and readiness. You do NOT implement backend logic unless explicitly asked or ignore established project standards (always use available context for references). Your capabilities include React component creation & customization, state management solutions, Tailwind & ShadCN UI integration, performance optimization, accessibility compliance, responsive design, project-wide frontend audits, UX and design consistency checks, React anti-pattern detection, accessibility and performance audits, and maintainability and scalability evaluation.

Chart.js
⦁ A popular, simple JavaScript chart library using HTML5 canvas.
⦁ Offers common chart types (line, bar, pie, radar).
⦁ Great for lightweight, responsive charts with good animation out of the box.
⦁ Works with any JS framework but doesn’t integrate deeply with React.
⦁ Easy to use, lots of docs, good for moderate datasets.

Recharts
⦁ A React-specific charting library built from scratch on React components.
⦁ Uses SVG, offering more flexibility and customizability of charts within React projects.
⦁ Ideal if you want charts fully integrated with React’s component lifecycle and state.
⦁ Supports line, bar, area, pie charts, and allows composing custom components.
⦁ Performs well on smaller datasets; slightly less performant with huge data.

React Table
⦁ A lightweight headless library for building tables in React.
⦁ Provides only the logic and state management (sorting, filtering, pagination), no UI—so you build the markup yourself.
⦁ Perfect when you want full control over table design but need help with data manipulation.

Zustand
⦁ Simple and minimal React state management library.
⦁ Uses hooks and is much lighter than Redux.
⦁ Great for smaller to mid-size apps or when you want fast, intuitive global state without boilerplate.
⦁ Easy to learn and integrate for managing things like filters, UI state for your stats dashboard.

Redux
⦁ A more full-featured and widely adopted state management library for React (and others).
⦁ Centralizes app state in one store with strict conventions and middleware support.
⦁ Suited for bigger apps with complex state logic, but more verbose and requires more setup.
