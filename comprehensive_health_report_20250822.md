## Issues Found and Fixes Applied

### 🔧 Critical Issues Resolved

#### 1. **Server Connectivity Issues**
- **Problem:** Flask API server not responding, connection refused errors
- **Root Cause:** Main process stopped, server not listening on expected port
- **Fix Applied:** 
  - Restarted main tennis system (`python main.py`)
  - Verified server binding to correct port (5001)
  - Confirmed all services initialized properly
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

#### 2. **Rate Limiting Too Restrictive**
- **Problem:** Health check endpoints returning 429 (rate limit exceeded)
- **Root Cause:** Rate limits set too low (20 requests/hour) for monitoring systems
- **Fix Applied:** 
  - Updated configuration: `20 per hour` → `200 per hour`
  - Increased minute limits: `5 per minute` → `30 per minute`
  - Daily limits: `100 per day` → `1000 per day`
- **File Modified:** `/home/apps/Tennis_one_set/src/config/config.py`
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

#### 3. **Missing API Endpoints**
- **Problem:** 404 errors on critical endpoints
  - `/api/betting/alerts` - Missing completely
  - `/api/betting/dashboard-stats` - Missing completely
- **Fix Applied:** 
  - Implemented betting alerts endpoint with system health monitoring
  - Created dashboard stats endpoint with comprehensive metrics
  - Added proper error handling and logging
- **File Modified:** `/home/apps/Tennis_one_set/src/api/routes.py`
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

#### 4. **Pylance Warnings in Test File**
- **Problem:** Unused imports and variables causing linting warnings
- **Fix Applied:**
  - Removed unused `json` import
  - Removed unused `get_betting_dashboard_stats` import
  - Fixed unused variable `stats` by replacing with underscore
- **File Modified:** `/home/apps/Tennis_one_set/test_prediction_betting_integration.py`
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
