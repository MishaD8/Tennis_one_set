# Tennis One Set - Tennis Prediction System

> A comprehensive machine learning system for tennis underdog prediction and match analysis.

## Overview

Tennis One Set is an advanced tennis prediction system that specializes in identifying strong underdogs likely to win the second set in ATP and WTA singles tournaments. The system focuses on players ranked 10-300 and uses machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy.


AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT FOR THE SYSTEM:


- First set momentum indicators (momentum score, break points saved/converted)
- Player fatigue modeling (previous match dates, travel distance)
- Weather/court conditions (if available)
- In-match form (service percentage, unforced errors in first set)
- Psychological pressure indicators (ranking pressure, tournament importance)# Implement these improvements

1. Neural Networks with LSTM for sequential match data
2. Gradient Boosting with custom tennis loss functions
3. Ensemble methods with dynamic weighting based on match context
4. Real-time model updating during matches

# Enhanced data collection

- Integrate tennis-specific APIs (TennisBot, Ultimate Tennis Statistics)
- Add betting market data for market efficiency analysis
- Include player interview/social media sentiment analysis
- Weather API integration for outdoor tournaments

# Live prediction pipeline

1. WebSocket connection to live match feeds
2. Real-time feature calculation during first set
3. Prediction updates every game/point
4. Dynamic confidence scoring based on match state

# Target APIs for live data
- WTA/ATP live scoring APIs
- Tennis-specific statistics providers
- Weather APIs for outdoor matches
- Betting exchange APIs for market data# Neural network for sequential data
