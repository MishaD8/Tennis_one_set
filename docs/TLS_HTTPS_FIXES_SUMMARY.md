# TLS/HTTPS Issues Resolution Summary

## Problem Analysis

The Flask application was receiving TLS handshake attempts (`\x16\x03\x01` bytes) on an HTTP-only server, causing these critical issues:

1. **Bad Request Errors**: HTTP server couldn't handle TLS handshake packets
2. **Dashboard Connection Failures**: Frontend couldn't connect properly
3. **Security Header Conflicts**: CSP `upgrade-insecure-requests` directive forced HTTPS on HTTP server
4. **HSTS Violations**: Strict Transport Security headers on HTTP connections

## Root Causes

1. **Forced HTTPS Upgrade**: CSP policy included `upgrade-insecure-requests` directive
2. **Environment-Unaware Security**: Security headers didn't adapt to HTTP/HTTPS context
3. **Poor Error Handling**: No specific handling for TLS handshake attempts
4. **Static CORS Configuration**: CORS didn't account for protocol switching

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Dynamic Security Headers (`tennis_backend.py`)

```python
@app.after_request
def set_security_headers(response):
    """Add comprehensive security headers with HTTP/HTTPS awareness"""
    # Check if we're running HTTPS or HTTP
    is_production = os.getenv('FLASK_ENV') == 'production'
    is_https = request.is_secure or request.headers.get('X-Forwarded-Proto') == 'https'
    
    # Only add HSTS in production with HTTPS
    if is_production and is_https:
        response.headers['Strict-Transport-Security'] = 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload'
    
    # Adaptive CSP based on protocol
    if is_https or is_production:
        # Secure CSP for HTTPS/Production
        csp = "default-src 'self'; ... upgrade-insecure-requests"
    else:
        # Relaxed CSP for HTTP development
        csp = "default-src 'self'; ... (no upgrade directive)"
```

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ **HSTS only for HTTPS production environments**
- ✅ **CSP removes `upgrade-insecure-requests` for HTTP development**
- ✅ **Allows both HTTP and HTTPS resources in development**
- ✅ **Maintains strict security for production**

### 2. Enhanced TLS Handshake Error Handling

```python
@app.errorhandler(400)
def bad_request(error):
    """Handle 400 errors with special handling for TLS handshake attempts"""
    request_data = request.get_data(as_text=False)
    if len(request_data) >= 3 and request_data[:3] == b'\x16\x03\x01':
        # TLS handshake detected
        logger.warning("TLS handshake attempt detected on HTTP-only server")
        return make_response(
            "HTTP/HTTPS Protocol Mismatch: This server currently accepts HTTP only.",
            400
        )
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Graceful handling of TLS attempts instead of crashes**
- ✅ **Informative error messages for debugging**
- ✅ **Proper logging for security monitoring**

### 3. Environment-Aware CORS Configuration

```python
def get_allowed_origins():
    """Get allowed origins based on environment"""
    if os.getenv('FLASK_ENV') != 'production':
        return [
            'http://localhost:5001',
            'https://localhost:5001', 
            'http://127.0.0.1:5001',
            'https://127.0.0.1:5001',
            'http://0.0.0.0:5001'
        ]
    else:
        return ['https://your-production-domain.com']
```

**Features:**
- ✅ **Supports both HTTP and HTTPS in development**
- ✅ **HTTPS-only for production security**
- ✅ **Flexible origin matching**

### 4. Optional HTTPS/TLS Support

```python
def check_ssl_certificates():
    """Check if SSL certificates are available for HTTPS"""
    # Check multiple certificate locations
    # Return certificate paths if found

def run_server():
    """Run server with HTTP or HTTPS based on configuration"""
    enable_ssl = os.getenv('ENABLE_SSL', 'false').lower() == 'true'
    cert_file, key_file = check_ssl_certificates()
    use_ssl = enable_ssl and ssl_available
    
    if use_ssl:
        app.run(ssl_context=(cert_file, key_file))
    else:
        app.run()  # HTTP mode
```

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ **Automatic SSL certificate detection**
- ✅ **Environment variable control**
- ✅ **Graceful fallback to HTTP**
- ✅ **Production-ready HTTPS support**

## Verification Results

### ✅ HTTP Endpoints Test
- Dashboard: Working (200 OK)
- Health Check: Working (200 OK)
- Statistics: Working (200 OK)

### ✅ Security Headers Test
- Content-Type-Options: Properly configured
- X-Frame-Options: Working
- CSP: No upgrade-insecure-requests for HTTP
- Referrer-Policy: Development-friendly
- HSTS: Correctly omitted for HTTP

### ✅ CORS Configuration Test
- Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers present
- Multiple protocol support working

## Environment Variables for Configuration

```bash
# Basic configuration
FLASK_ENV=development          # or 'production'
PORT=5001
HOST=0.0.0.0

# HTTPS configuration
ENABLE_SSL=true               # Enable HTTPS support
SSL_CERT_FILE=cert.pem        # Certificate file path
SSL_KEY_FILE=key.pem          # Private key file path

# CORS configuration
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5001,https://localhost:5001
```

## Security Benefits Maintained

1. **Development Flexibility**: Works correctly with both HTTP and HTTPS
2. **Production Security**: Full security headers for HTTPS production
3. **Attack Prevention**: XSS, clickjacking, and content-sniffing protection
4. **Monitoring**: Enhanced logging for security events
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of protocol mismatches
