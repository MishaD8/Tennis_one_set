⦁ From the previous dashboard, you can only leave the display of matches that were actually included in the selection for betting. You can also leave the background and color palette of the entire site. You can completely remove the turquoise bar at the very top of the site. No explanation is needed as to what this site does.

⦁ Detailed betting simulation: Show capital growth starting with $100 bets, track ROI over time, drawdowns, max losing streaks, and winning streaks per model. Plot an equity curve for over week/month to see volatility and performance side-by-side.

⦁ ML performance dashboard: Display win rate, profit %, average odds, number of bets, streak lengths (wins and losses), and maybe more advanced metrics like Sharpe ratio or Kelly criterion. 

⦁ Streak visualizations: Use timeline bars or run charts to highlight streak length & frequency, so you know if a losing streak is typical or unusual and when a winning streak is likely.

⦁ Filter and drill-down: Allow filtering by tournament, surface, player rank, or bookmaker odds range to evaluate ML models performance in different contexts.

⦁ Money management insight: Include simulations of different staking plans (flat bet, Kelly, proportional) to see how bankroll would evolve under each model and betting strategy.

⦁ Confidence intervals: Show prediction confidence or probability bins so you can gauge which bets carry more reliable edges.

⦁ Backtesting and forward testing: Allow toggling between past test data and recent live data to see if ML model performance is stable or degrading.

⦁ Since capital growth & streaks matter most, focus on visualizing equity curves + streak timelines + per-model detailed stats. 

⦁ Logging your actual bets and outcomes will help you refine things over time.
