  ðŸŽ¯ PROJECT SCORECARD: 7.5/10

  ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Immediately):

  1. SECURITY VULNERABILITY - Exposed API keys in .env file
    - Live API_TENNIS_KEY, TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN exposed
    - Action: Rotate credentials immediately
  2. Project Structure Bloat - 82 Python files in root directory
    - Impact: Maintenance nightmare
    - Action: Reorganize into modules (api/, ml/, data/, utils/)
  3. Duplicate Functionality - Multiple files doing same thing
    - tennis_backend.py vs app.py (both Flask apps)
    - 15+ scattered test files
    - Action: Consolidate redundant code

  âœ… MAJOR STRENGTHS:

  - ML Architecture: 9/10 - Sophisticated 5-model ensemble (78%+ accuracy)
  - API Design: 8/10 - Comprehensive Flask backend with proper security
  - Real Data Integration: Multiple APIs with smart caching

  ðŸ”§ MEDIUM PRIORITY FIXES:

  - Move 6MB ML models to external storage
  - Consolidate 22MB cached data with cleanup policies
  - Reorganize 20+ markdown docs
  - Improve test coverage and organization

  ðŸ“Š PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:

  - Add response compression and caching
  - Implement connection pooling for database
  - Optimize ML model loading with lazy loading

  The system is production-ready but needs immediate security fixes and structural cleanup for long-term maintainability. Would
  you like me to start with the critical security fixes first?
