1 - The system should identify strong underdogs who are likely to win SECOND set.

2 - Only ATP and WTA singles tournaments should be included in the system.

3 - For our models, use only best-of-3 sets format as in ATP tournaments. Grand Slam events like Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open use best-of-5 sets but we will exclude those formats from our analysis.

4 - FOCUSING ONLY on ranks 50-300

5 - Use machine learning models to improve the accuracy of underdog predictions, specifically targeting underdogs likely to win SECOND SET !!!
