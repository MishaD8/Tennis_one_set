üéæ SECOND SET PREDICTION - INTEGRATION INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================

STEP 1: FILE ADDITIONS
----------------------
‚úÖ Copy these new files to your project:
- second_set_feature_engineering.py
- second_set_prediction_service.py  
- second_set_integration.py

STEP 2: BACKEND MODIFICATIONS
-----------------------------
Modify tennis_backend.py with the following changes:

A) ADD IMPORTS (around line 40):
```python
try:
    from second_set_integration import SecondSetIntegrator
    SECOND_SET_AVAILABLE = True
    print("‚úÖ Second set prediction integration loaded")
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Second set integration not available: {e}")
    SECOND_SET_AVAILABLE = False
```

B) ADD GLOBAL VARIABLE (around line 130):
```python
second_set_integrator = None
```

C) MODIFY initialize_services() (around line 360):
```python
# Initialize Second Set Integrator
if SECOND_SET_AVAILABLE:
    try:
        global second_set_integrator
        second_set_integrator = SecondSetIntegrator()
        logger.info("‚úÖ Second Set Integrator initialized")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"‚ùå Second set integration failed: {e}")
```

D) REPLACE UnderdogAnalyzer class (around line 370):
- Replace the entire UnderdogAnalyzer class with the modified version
- The new version uses second set specialized prediction when available
- Falls back to original logic if second set integration fails

STEP 3: MODEL RETRAINING (CRITICAL)
----------------------------------
üö® IMPORTANT: Current models predict general match outcomes, not second set outcomes!

Required actions:
1. Collect historical tennis data with SET-BY-SET results
2. Create training dataset with target: "underdog_won_second_set" 
3. Use SecondSetFeatureEngineer to generate features
4. Retrain all 5 models with second set target
5. Save new models in tennis_models/ directory

Minimum data requirements:
- 15,000+ matches with set-by-set results
- Various tournament levels and surfaces  
- Focus on matches where underdog lost first set
- Balance underdog wins/losses in second set

STEP 4: TESTING
---------------
1. Start the server: python tennis_backend.py
2. Test endpoint: GET /api/matches
3. Look for prediction_focus: "SECOND_SET_UNDERDOG_WINS"
4. Verify key factors mention second set dynamics

STEP 5: LIVE DATA INTEGRATION
-----------------------------
For production, replace simulate_first_set_data() with real live match data:
- Connect to live tennis data feed
- Extract first set results as they complete
- Feed real first set stats to second set predictor

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
=================
‚úÖ Predictions focus on second set specifically
‚úÖ Better accuracy for underdog set wins vs match wins  
‚úÖ Key factors highlight second set dynamics
‚úÖ Market advantage over general match betting
‚úÖ "Nothing to lose" scenarios identified
‚úÖ Momentum and adaptation factors considered

STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES:
====================
üéØ More specific than "any set" predictions
üìä Captures tennis-specific momentum shifts  
‚ö° Identifies underdog opportunities in second set
üß† Considers psychological factors and adaptation
üí∞ Potential higher accuracy for specialized betting markets
üîÑ Better handles comeback scenarios and player patterns

NEXT STEPS AFTER INTEGRATION:
=============================
1. Monitor prediction accuracy on live matches
2. Collect real second set outcome data for validation
3. Fine-tune model weights for second set dynamics
4. Consider third set prediction as next enhancement
5. Analyze profitability vs general match predictions
